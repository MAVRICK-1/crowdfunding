# CROWDFUNDING CONTRACT

A crowdfunding smart contract is a decentralized application (DApp) built on blockchain technology that allows individuals or organizations to raise funds from a community of backers in a transparent and secure manner. This type of contract eliminates the need for intermediaries like crowdfunding platforms or banks, providing direct peer-to-peer interactions and trust through blockchain.
